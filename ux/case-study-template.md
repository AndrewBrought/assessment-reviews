# UX Case Study Template
If you are interested in building a short and sweet case study for your 
project, here's a template to fill out.

### The Client:
- Who hired/asked you to build this project?

### My Role: 
- What was your role and what tasks were you responsible for?

### Problem Statement:
- What is the problem you are trying to solve with this project or this UX 
case study? 

### Project Goals:
- What are the main goals for the project? I typically represent this as an 
ordered/unordered list.

### Approach:
- How do you expect to accomplish these goals?

### Research Methods:
- What are your strategies for research?

### User Personas:
- Who is going to be using your product? This should be a detailed description
of your target user/s.

### Resources:
- What outside resources did you use to complete this? What about your own 
resources? This could be links to a branding guide, the current site you are 
redesigning, etc.

### Process:
- This is where you would link parts of your design process. Site Map, Trello
 board, Diagrams, Wireframes, Mockups and Prototypes.

### Calendar:
- If you have a timeline for completing project features, you can put it here.
